Cloud-based analysis, compression and storage

#7 - Differences in metadata
      - NIFTI
      - MINC
      - ISMRMRD - wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/ismrmrd/files/data/simple_gre.h5
      - https://ismrmrd.github.io/

#8 - provenance in MINC file vs Nifti (no metadata so have to use script)

#9 - Create releasable fileset
   - always include code versions with data
      - how to get the versions of packages you are using (dpkg -- list)
   - always include parameters with data
   - be sure to clean history from data (anonymise)
      - perhaps best is via Nifti

#9.1 - learn to script (bash)

#10 - versioning

#11 - Brief introduction to Licencing

#12 - upload to figshare/mendelay?
      - self host? (bad)
      - let's use github

#13 - create a simple github repo (online)
      - intialise with files
      - add README.md + COPYING.md
      - Add versioning via tags
      - Note how versioning turns into release

#14 - create a DOI
